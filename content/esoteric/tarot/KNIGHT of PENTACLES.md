The KNIGHT of PENTACLES sits on an unmoving horse. He has put in much work tilling the soil, preparing the land for a new garden to be grown. He has a seed to offer, but he is not planting it. He seems to be waiting for somethingâ€”maybe someone, to hand it off to.

The Knight is a considerate person, maybe a little bit boring, but concerned about the big picture, long-term, slower view.
