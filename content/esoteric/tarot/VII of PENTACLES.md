In the process of growing your garden, you will have to wait. It is exciting to see your crop grow, but you must practice restraintâ€”there's no sense in picking at it before it has matured. Be patient. Your time will come.

> I call it the boring adult shit card. No changes just waiting in the here and now for something to happen. I don't see it as a failure at all, but you doing what you have to do at this moment in time until the next stage comes. (And to keep doing what you have been doing...don't stop)  To me there is an uneasiness maybe? Like slight discontentment could be read into the card like "nothing is happening. When is the fun going to start?" But giving up and failure is far from that...you don't see the man leaving his field...just kinda bored with what he has to do with it right Now.
