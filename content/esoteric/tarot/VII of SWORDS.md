*The perfect storm of events; threading the needle, making it through, getting away with itâ€”unnoticed.*

Many are biased against the VII of SWORDS because it's known as the "thief" card, carrying themes of deception and selfishness. However, this card is also about cunning. It's about needing to put yourself first and prioritise your own needs over others. It can be a great card to remind you not to allow yourself to be walked over by others.

The VII of SWORDS is about courage, thinking quickly and strategising. It is about thinking outside the box, creating new strategies on the fly.
