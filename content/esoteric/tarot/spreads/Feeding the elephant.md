I originally heard about this spread from https://parsifalswheeldivination.org/, but it seems like it's since been taken down.

The general idea is to try and understand what unspoken archetype might be contributing to your conflict with another person. Person A/B represents the energy they're bringing in. The elephant (in the room) describes how those energies clash. The action/reaction slot may be used to describe the way that energy is channeled, through their predispositions. Outside interests can help you understand the trajectory of each person's individual journey. 

Sometimes, it may be helpful to use two cards to represent the elephant in the room. This does not serve to divide the elephant in two, but rather, to gain a deeper understanding of what happens when both peoples energies mix. If you use this modification, I would caution you from assigning one card to one person or the otherâ€”after all, we have cards to describe each person already.

The compromise may serve as a good place to continue with a follow-up spread, but the above material should provide ample food for thought.
