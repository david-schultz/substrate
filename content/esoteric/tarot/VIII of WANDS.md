Fast acting energy happening behind the scenes. It's like the full force of the spirit flowing through the vessel.

> There is a chance that the decision that you are waiting for will come your way soon. You need to be patient and just wait for it. Perhaps important news will be coming on your way, and you may experience a sudden, yet steady positive growth.
> 
> When it comes to love, the eight of wands meaning pertains to your readiness to be committed on a relationship; however, the card advises you not to force the other party to also be ready on the commitment. Your significant other will soon be ready - forcing things to happen may affect the result negatively. In terms of finances, it appears like this is not the best time to make hasty investment. Just like in your love aspect, we advise you to be patient. Save your money and wait for the perfect time to invest. All things that you fought for are building in momentum. Where you didn't see progress earlier, you'll soon discover that they paved the way for the coming wave of action.
