The III of PENTACLES depicts teamwork. Depicted is a young man sharing his ideas, deliberating over the best course of action with maybe his peers, or more likely his more experienced mentors. The thing is, we all have something to learn from each other, and it is in their mutual respect—i.e. their shared emotional security—where they can find the best results.

Interestingly, there is strong overlap with the [[3H (House of Exchange)]].
