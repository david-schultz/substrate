u/KBTarot
> I like the comparisons to [[XI, JUSTICE|JUSTICE]] people give here. While Justice is taking action to bring relationships within the world to balance, Judgment does the same between the physical and the spiritual; this can often be described as a "calling". The other dynamic in the card is the choice you make - are you willing to follow the calling and align yourself with the spiritual plan set forth for you?


u/paisleyrose25:
> This card is acceptance, understanding, and peace. Unlike Justice- which typically deals with an external righting of the scales, Judgement tends to be more internal. Itâ€™s making peace with ourselves.
