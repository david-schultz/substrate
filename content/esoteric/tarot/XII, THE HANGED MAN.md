Reversed
u/annabellagreen:
> Since I've come to notice the hanged man seems to mean to be "left hanging," put on pause, I've felt like reversed it means "enlightened" "clarity" and no longer left hanging. Also, sort of if hanged man is like "meditating" then reverse him, he's come out of his meditation. This makes sense to me at least.

u/Tower_Experience
> The hanged man in reversed followed me around for a while. I see a few different interpretations on it, and together with the other cards you describe pulling, I lean towards one meaning. You are coming out of a period of being suspended from action. Itâ€™s both a stagnant energy and an in between phase that you have been through, and that you have learned a lesson from. Now the hanged man is upright again, ready to take action on something based on the new perspective he (you) have gotten when being forced to stand still for a while. It might also mean that you need to put your foot down on some issue in your life. The action you need to take will move the situation forward and finally end a painful situation (the ten of swords).

u/cedarandroses:
> Reversed the Hanged Man looks to me to be standing up in tree pose. He's awake, meditating and illuminated. I read this as the active and dynamic (yang?) version of the card's energy whereas upright I read the card as embodying the more yin version of the same theme (sacrifice, withholding).
