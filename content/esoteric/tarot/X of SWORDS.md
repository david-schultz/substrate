Clearly, the figure has fought and lost. It was a horrible way to go... but such a beautiful last moment to behold. The battle is over, the smoke is clearing, and the morning sun is rising.

Someone once described this card as over-dramatic, and it is. You can kind of laugh at how it all went down.

u/32themoon:
> 10 of swords. complete but necessary ending. It can be difficult and, at times, painful. It ushers in teachable moments too. The main consolation is that the event has ended and you're able to never return to it (if you put the time and effort to move past it, of course.) Ex: Completion of a toxic relationship.
> 10 of swords reversed. you may try to avoid total endings. One may be unable to make peace with a conclusion or it's results. He may be missing lessons that exist behind painful events and even holding onto past dynamics. In the moment it may feel good because you're able to avoid a painful ending but the action of avoidance can lead to stagnation or missed lessons. Ex: Holding onto a bad job because they don't want to be fired, keeping a relationship alive and missing why it needs to be terminated. Holding on just a little bit longer.
