> Walking away, moving on. The eight of cups is a reminder that you do not have to settle if you sense that there is something missing in your life. You don't need to knew exactly what you are missing, though you must be willing to follow your heart and instinct toward a more meaningful existence. In order to make that journey, you will need to release things that once brought you happiness, including people, behaviours, objects, and places.

Leaving the cups behind does not mean they won't be there when you get back. But there is something missing, and you must leave safety—retreat to the mountains, if you will—in order to find that last piece of the puzzle.
