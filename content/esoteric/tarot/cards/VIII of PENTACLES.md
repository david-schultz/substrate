Working hard, focusing on your craft. There is much to do, and the best thing you can do right now is to keep churning it out. You are creating value for the world, and your unique sense of [[Awe|Beauty]] is the essential ingredient to the product of your effort.

This is the card of getting absorbed into your work. The figure is far from town, in his own world. But rememberâ€”to do your work well, you must maintain your mind, body, and spirit. It is only when all three are in balance that you can truly do your best work. (imo)
