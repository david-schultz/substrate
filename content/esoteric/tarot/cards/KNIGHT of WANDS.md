The Knight of Wands is seen on his horse that is reared up and ready for action. Judging from the knight’s clothes and armor, as well as his horse, he is prepared for what’s ahead. He is wearing a yellow patterned shirt on top of his metal armor. He is also wearing an armor helmet with red plume sticking out of it. He seems to be ready for battle, except he is holding a large wand instead of a sword. His horse is orange in color and has a mane that looks like flames. When you look at the Knight of Wands' face, you’ll see the determination of wanting to be successful in his endeavor. Fire is a dominate factor in the Knight of Wands' symbolism. The decorative tassels hanging from his arms and back, as well as the horse’s mane, are all in the color of flame. He is also wearing a yellow shirt printed with the fiery salamander symbol.

### Upright
The Knight of Wands' symbolism is straightforward. When it appears, it means a great time to get away and travel. The person should feel charged up and full of life. One is also ready to get things done. He is adventurous and can find fun things to do no matter where he is. There is never a dull moment when the Knight of Wands is around. When the Knight of Wands shows up in a reading it seems to suggest that the seeker wants to complete important tasks. One wants to impress others with one’s knowledge and skill. The card also shows up when the person is planning to move to another place of residence.

If you are starting a creative project, then you should do so with lots of energy and enthusiasm. However, you should balance it with realistic and well-rounded views. You should also have a plan that takes into account the consequences of your actions.

##### In love
Someone who is full of vitality and fearlessness may have just entered your love life with the Knight of Wands tarot love meaning. They are likely to be very impulsive, charming, and passionate. But their rash and volatile nature can make it difficult for them to settle down with one person. If this card doesn’t represent a person, it can instead point to a period in your love life that is exciting, but also erratic and adventurous. You may be more prone to taking risks at this time, which can pay off handsomely. Fear of rejection may not be a problem at this moment.


### Reversed
When you get a reversed Knight of Wands, it indicates frustrations and delays. You may feel angry and that you are not getting anywhere. A reversed Knight of Wands can translate to a loss of power. You may be trying to compensate for something that you don’t have total control over - this might lead to pessimism and loss of self-esteem.

##### In love
You or another person in your life may be running from the idea of commitment right now. The reversed Knight of Wands tarot love meaning indicates impatience, instability and recklessness. This person may find themselves chasing after their heart’s desire one moment, but when they have it, quickly change his mind after. They may love the pursuit of romance, but not so much the simple, steady love that comes after. If you’re in a relationship, you may find that it feels unsteady right now, but this can also be due to the changes in your environment. Arguments are easy to spark now.
