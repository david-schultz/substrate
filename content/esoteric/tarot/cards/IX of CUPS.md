*My meditation partner. Look how smug he is.*

The IX of Cups depicts a man sitting comfortably in front of a row of cups, arms crossed. He is sort of like an arbiter; only with his approval will he let you pass.

**For one who is prone to [[Attachment styles|anxious attachment]]:**
> He watches you fight the final boss—yourself—as you cycle through spasms of self-inflicted suffering and moments of meditative peace. 

**For one who is prone to [[Attachment styles|avoidant attachment]]:**
> He watches you carefully inch forward, building up the confidence, before you suddenly experience of flash of anxiety and scurry off. But your curiousity compells you to keep coming back, and the man lets you gradually build up your trust on your own.

The IX of Cups is sort of like the threshold to the locked portion of the map—and when it appears to you, reversed, it's telling you that you have more quests to complete before you're ready to continue to this portion of the game. Consider asking: what is the key?
