The QUEEN of PENTACLES sits in her garden, gazing lovingly at her posessions. She has grown many a garden, with much success. She's crafty and practical, kind of like a Mackenzie Bezos figure.

She knows what's valuable to her. At the bottom of the card, on the right-hand side, a rabbit is pouncing into the frame, which symbolizes her high energy and fertility. The Queen of Pentacles, therefore, depicts a certain level of success and prosperity. But the rabbit at the bottom cautions us that we should be careful of where we leap when we are chasing that success.

When ==reversed==, she may be overly focused on her posessions. I like to think of her in this situation as a wine mom.
