You feel balanced

u/coolcrowe:
> One analogy that might work better for you is tempering steel. You have to get it very hot with fire, then plunge it into water to cool it off. It takes both extremes to make the steel strong; the seemingly irreconcilable opposing elements complement one another and temper it.

### Other
> Temperance, in a general sense, refers to moderation or self-restraint, particularly in the indulgence of natural appetites or passions. It's a virtue that emphasizes balance and control in actions, thoughts, and feelings, encouraging individuals to avoid excess and find a middle ground
