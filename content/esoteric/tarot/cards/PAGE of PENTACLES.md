The page of pentacles is the most studious of the bunch. She is ambitious and diligent; a strong, goal-oriented planner. She is grounded, loyal, faithful, and dependable, and above all, focused on what is most important to her.

> The Page of Pentacles card depicts a youth standing all by himself in a wide field surrounded by flowers. In the background, you will also notice several lush trees and a furrowed field. The young man seems to be walking in a slow manner and appears unaware of his surroundings, for his attention is completely captured by the coin he is holding, and all that it represents: ambition, security, wealth, nature, and sensuality. The Page of Pentacles symbolizes a person who is grounded, loyal and diligent.



Love
> The person symbolized by the Page of Pentacles is ambitious, loyal and practical; they may often be seen as studious, but once you get to know them well, they can also be quite funny. Their ambition and focus means that they are hardworking. They are likely to be as dedicated as they are to a lover, as they are to their goals. Their quiet demeanor may make them hard to notice at first, compared to other folks that may be more out going.

> If this doesn’t represent a person that is entering your love life, the Page of Pentacles tarot love meaning can simply signal this Page’s dedication and loyalty in your relationship. While sometimes the relationship can lack passion and feel a bit boring, the love is there; you may only need to go out there and figure out how to inject some fun and excitement back into your romance. Try not to always put practicality before passion in the relationship and the two of you should be just fine.
