![[4_ofpentacles.png]]Depicted is a man holding on tightly to his posessions. In a way, he has isolated himself from society via his entitlement to what is "his". There are many situations in which it is important to hold onto your resources. However, with his muscles so tense (opposite the [[II of PENTACLES]]), his movement is restricted, and will lead to stagnation.

Let loose, let go. Sometimes, you have to take the risk, or a hit to your tangible security.
