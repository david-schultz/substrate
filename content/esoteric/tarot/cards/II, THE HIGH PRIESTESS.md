u/YlvaBlue:
> The High Priestess is definitely tricky. I know the books like to talk about her being the card of intuition, of mystery etc, and it all sounds very mystical and romantic.

> In reality, I find her to be the ultimate 'no' card. The 'it's none of your business' card. Or the 'you already know the answer but you don't like it so you're asking me to see if I'm going to tell you something different' card.  Sometimes she's the 'you'll find out when you've grown up a little bit so get going on that personal development' card. Other times, she's the 'you don't need to know the answer to this, so jog on' card.

> Which makes her probably the sassiest card of the deck, and the most frustrating. However, she's a very good reminder of the boundaries that exist, that we're not the centre of the universe, and that not everything is for us to know - the time will come when we do find out the answer we're searching for, but we're not ready, so it's not now. (Since I work in constellations, I partner her with Justice and Judgement. Therefore, the answer comes as a natural consequence to my actions (Justice), or as a wake-up call (Judgement)).

> She's a card that *should* force us to be very honest with ourselves and pull our ego into check - which has usually gone into full overdrive after our experience of being the Magician, when it feels like we can do anything/make anything happen - but...well, that's just a bit hard to swallow, isn't it?

> As to your other question: Temperance. Still can't get my head round it.
