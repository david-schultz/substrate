![[kingofpentacles.png]]The KING of PENTACLES is enmeshed in his material success. (Maybe too enmeshed). He has grown a garden, and become a part of the garden. He has found much abundance, and is an excellent providerâ€”but he doesn't have much horizontal leeway. He is not particularly flexible. And when there is no movement, there is stagnation. It is worth considering, then, the bones at his feet. (Sometimes, this may represent insecurities, stuffed away.)
