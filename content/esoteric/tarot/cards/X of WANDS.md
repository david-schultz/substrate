You take all the burdens, the responsibilities you've accumulated through the project, and you bring them across the finish line. Setting them down at town in a puff of smoke, no reward but the compensation for your services & the satisfaction of a job well done.

Those logs will be used for something more, which means the wands cycle is far quicker the the other elements. Passion is brief, and is not an easy thing to maintain. The fire may change form, or wither out as the project continues and the responsibilities mount.

But the key thing is, you do it for yourself. Yes, the recognition from the [[VI of WANDS]] is part of the cycle, but the external validation is not where its culmination lies. It instead culminates intrinsicallyâ€”from the internal satisfaction, relief, and joy of creation.
