Fighting off impulses ([[FIRE & WANDS]] connection)


| upright                                | reversed                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| battle, defiance, standing your ground | yielding, rest, giving up |
The Seven of Wands in Tarot generally represents standing your ground, defending your position, and resisting challenges. It suggests a situation where you need to assert yourself, potentially facing opposition or competition, but also indicates the courage and resilience to do so.

### Upright

### Reversed

> There's no need to assert your will, right now. There may not even be an actual battle to fight. You don't need to do anything, let the energy of the [[VIII of WANDS]] do it's thing BTS.
