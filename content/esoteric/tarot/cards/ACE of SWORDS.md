> The Ace of Swords is a tarot card that can represent mental clarity, success, and **breakthroughs**. It can also indicate a challenge that will test you.  With its sharp blade and representing the power of the intellect, this sword has the ability to cut through deception and find truth. In layman's terms, this card represents that moment in which one can see the world from a new point of view, as a place that is filled with nothing but new possibilities. It is, therefore, the best time to work on your goals - as the aces all give green lights, and are signals of waiting opportunities and new beginnings.
> It might also be a good time for you to seek justice and the truth in all matters since your conscience is clear, and your thoughts are swift. If you rise to the occasion, your sharpness and clarity in thought will be rewarded. 

### Reversed
> The possibility for victory, if appropriate decisions are made. Chaos or complications may occur. Negativity, hostility, anarchy.
