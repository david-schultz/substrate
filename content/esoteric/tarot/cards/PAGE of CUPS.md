Labyrinthos
> Shy, hesitant and maybe a little awkward, the Page of Cups tarot love meaning can point to someone in your romantic life with these characteristics. They may react well to some much needed kindness, slowly opening up to you if they feel safe. Sometimes however, this person may also be a bit emotionally immature; there could be temper tantrums, insecurity, and lots of nonsense. Should this card not represent a person, be aware of these traits in yourself. Have your insecurities gotten the best of you? How have they affected your romantic life?
