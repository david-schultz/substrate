### Reversed
> The tower in reverse implies a dramatic internal challenge. Upright it could mean the loss of a job that forces you to move out of your home but in reverse it is an internal conflict. It signifies a powerful time of inner turmoil and conflict. If paired with the high priestess or hermit it would indicate the transformation of inner self and learning lessons through hardship. With the 7 of swords it could mean extreme guilt or shame over your own bad behavior. Reversals arenâ€™t always bad! If you get a daily card that confuses you I would pull an extra one or two to clarify its meaning. Good luck to you!

> Is there a climbing wall at your gym? That's the Lightning Struck Tower upside down: ascent and achievement but only after suffering some rope burns. Be sure you have an experienced and capable belay partner and a helmet, metaphorically speaking.


u/thesillygirl25:
> To me, tower in reverse has always always been not letting go of something even if it's over, be it holding resentments for someone, bottling it up or holding on to the past, being stuck on it even if it's long gone, so for me it's not letting go, resisting
> It could also mean avoided disaster sometimes

> Never pulled this one for myself before. To me the imagery reversed looks like a tower being plunged into water. The people, rather than falling to their demise, have escaped and are swimming toward the surface. To me this card represents difficult change, but a hopeful outcome. Slightly cheerier than the upright! What do you think?
