This card depicts a woman, bondaged, "trapped" within her own intellect—or the intellect of others. She likely feels trapped and restricted—paralyzed, and maybe even helpless.

But here's the thing—those bonds look a little bit shoddy. And while she can't quite see, her feet are unbound. They can feel the water below, a small stream of intuition back towards the castle. She can set herself free.
