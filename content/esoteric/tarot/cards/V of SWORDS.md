Victory, but at what cost?

Consider each character depicted. The figure in the foreground has won (the argument), but his pride, self-absorption, and over-intellectualization stops him from engaging with the emotions at hand.

Sometimes, debates are just that—debates. But in the case of the V of SWORDS, this argument was not about who was externally right, but rather, internal needs not being met. [[Emotions are rational|Emotions are not illogical]]—they simply operate in a different playing field.


### Reversed
> The message I would take away is- not everything needs a resolution, sometimes it’s ok to just walk away leaving things unfinished. Relationships don’t need big blow ups or drastic cut-all-ties-block-on-every-social-media-platforms to end, you can just stop putting energy toward them. Challenging situations don’t always require some deadline or formal ending, you can just walk away.  Your friend is grieving, and that takes a lot of energy. It’s ok if they conserve that energy by simply walking away from those things and people that aren’t serving them right now.
