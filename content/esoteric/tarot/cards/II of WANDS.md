The Two of Wands card features a man standing on top of what looks like a castle and in his right hand he holds a miniature globe. From the way he is standing, the man is looking down upon the vast terrain, in which an ocean lies on the left-hand side, whilst the land stretches over on the right-hand side. The man is wearing an orange tunic and a red hat, symbolizing his enthusiasm towards life itself and hunger for adventure respectively. The miniature globe in his hand represents potential for possible expansion of his reach to broader life experiences.

The Two of Wands is a more mature version of the ace of wands, meaning that that this tarot card is all about planning and moving forward â€“ progression. Look at it this way; you have already set out to achieve a particular task, which means you have turned an idea into a realistic plan. Such a plan will require fulfillment and therefore you have to progress from just having the plan to actually achieving what you set out for.

Discovery is being considered as another two of wands meaning. This is because it means that you are stepping out of your cocoon and exploring new experiences and worlds. While the beginning might seem tough and difficult, the Two of Wands card encourages you to strive on and push forward.
