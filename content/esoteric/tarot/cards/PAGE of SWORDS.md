The PAGE of SWORDS is on a quest. She is curious and witty—communicative and chatty. She knows not much, but her mental agility gives her the confidence to lean into any situation, and come out the other side equipped with new knowledge.

Her boots, red, to me represent hot heels. She's impulsive, jumping into situations that might've benefited from a bit more planning (note: the figure in the [[II of WANDS]] wears the same boots). She may not be aware of the double-edged nature of her sword.

overview
> The Page of Swords card is representative of a person in one's life who shows an abundance of energy. With wind-blown trees, turbulent clouds and the their tossed hair, a youth stands proudly on a rocky precipice. This energetic youth has a sword in her hands. Her expression is one of determination, and perhaps a little bit of defiance - she seems ready to pounce at the slightest word.

upright
> Bright and alert, the Page of Swords is someone who never seems to run out of ideas. She is curious, always asking questions, and gifted with a sharp tongue and quick wit to match. Her aptitude for language also makes her an incredible communicator, and with her love of ideas, you may find her always engaged in some passionate debate.

reversed
> When the Page of Swords is reversed, all the negative characteristics of her come out - and she may become almost dangerous. Being gifted with a sharp and alert mind, she may be using it for deception and manipulation. The sword that she wields may be used to create pain, her natural gift for language turned to a weapon. She may lack the understanding or the maturity to understand the suffering that she causes, feeling the rush that one gets upon lashing out. On the other hand, this page may be someone of empty words or promises - who though loves talking, does not really talk about much of substance. Take care to show strength and action behind your words, for you may be damaging

u/Elithomas1:
> Once I heard another person say that the pages bear messages associated with their suit. It just seems appropriate that if you feel like this is a message that it would be a page to go along with that feeling. The page of swords is the earthy part of air. I sometimes I think of this influence as a defender of an idea. Maybe even someone who protects a sacred truth from the forces that wish to engulf it. This person has an ability to see into the mists because they can easily move in the fog. In fact fog is also a great way to think of the earthy part of air. How does fog relate to you in your current situation? Are you defending some part of yourself from attack. Looking over your shoulder so to speak. Have you been peering into the mists of someone else’s life? Maybe it’s a warning to not spy on someone. Alternatively it could be suggesting you do a dactyl that and examine what may be someone’s hidden motivations(which could be good or bad but are just hidden).
