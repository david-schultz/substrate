I don't chase, I attract

### Traits
> optimistic, passionate, confident; the cat presents a nice contrast, highlighting the quiet, perceptive, observant part inside her.

### Personality

### Experiences
> The queen of wands used to be about the woman of my dreams. But I've since learned, that the traights I was looking for and admiring in other people were projects—they're traits of the person *I* want to be.


# Random

Give yourself time to be gentle, to listen, and to address any feelings of insecurity that are lingering.
