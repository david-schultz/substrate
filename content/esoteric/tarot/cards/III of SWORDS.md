![[3_ofswords.png]]You've been gutted. Heartbroken, stabbed with sharp pain. For it to heal properly, the swords must be pulled out—carefully, slowly—but pulled out nonetheless. [[AIR & SWORDS]] representing thought, it may be a sign that this is not the time to over-intellectualize. *Thinking* about it should be in service to digestion, and aid you in communing with your feelings in a healthy way. But as long as you continue to ruminate, those swords will stay in place.

It is worth noting that this is one of the only cards without a person.
