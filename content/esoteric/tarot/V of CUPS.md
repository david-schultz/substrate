![[5_ofcups.png]]
Tragedy; the cups *(from the [[IV of CUPS|IV]]?)* have spilled, and the figure must embrace the grief that comes with. He is isolated on his side of the river. But the good news is that not all is lost. Two cups are still standing, and the bridge to town is fully intact.

At some point, once he has digested his grief, he must find acceptance, move on, and rejoin societyâ€”bringing his two cups with him.
