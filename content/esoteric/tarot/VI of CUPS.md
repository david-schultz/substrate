![[6_ofcups.png]]
There are usually two ideas associated with this card: the past, and a childlike innocence. This happens to echo a major theme in my life, which is about continually shedding the jade that smothers one's [[Awe]] and appreciation of how beautiful life is.

To be human is to learn and negotiate patterns, in our path to [[Reverse entropy principle|spiritual fulfillment]]. But the patterns/knowledge we learn is contextual, and it is important that we remain open to updating our understanding.

The VI of CUPS advises you to take notice of the patterns that guide you in the present moment. Are they helping, or hindering? Are they keeping you safe, or exposing you to stagnation? Is this an opportunity for you to evolve?

Stay optimistic! Don't become [[Jadedness|jaded]]! Look for the truest good :)

u/trixie1128:
> In general: finding your inner child, seeing the world with new eyes w/o bias, simple joys, nostalgia, and returning to the most pure version of myself. As adults it's easy to lose sight of your dreams as we get jaded. This card tends to come up when I need to indulge in things I loved as a kid, and remember who I wanted to grow up to be, and check if that's what I'm really working toward now.
