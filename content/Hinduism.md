Man, there are so many cool concepts in Hinduism. Of all the established religions—if you're trying to understand what is going on in this thing we call existence, *this* seems to be the place to truly dive deep.

> It is very much worth mentioning that you should take my descriptions of these ancient concepts with a massive grain of salt. I am not a yogi, and I will surely have misunderstood some of these concepts. But, as I put the pieces of the puzzle together, I find that it is temporarily okay to deviate from institutional knowledge. So—I use these concepts to shape the story I'm trying to tell—and I am all ears if I've gotten anything wrong. (so let me knowwww)
