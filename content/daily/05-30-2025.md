Song of the day:

Some things I thought about today:
- Today I'm experiencing a sharp [[Bipolar|upswing]], and am finding that lamotrigine really helps to even me out
- The [[Hump of understanding]]
- When you find yourself in an argument, it is important to determine whether it is in the arena of logic, or the realm of emotion. Neither is better than the other; they're simply different modes of being.
- Dolphins take pufferfish and smoke them, lmao
- [[Dancing]] is the exact center between [[Masculine]] and [[Feminine]]
