> It is very much worth mentioning that you should take my descriptions/perspective of these ancient concepts with a massive grain of salt. I am not a yogi, and I will surely have misunderstood, in some fashion. But, as I put the pieces of the puzzle together, I find that it is okay to temporarily deviate from institutional knowledge. So—I use these concepts to shape the story I'm trying to tell—and am all ears if I've gotten anything wrong.


> Samsara is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that you have pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
> Just kidding, sort of. Samsara is the state where when something happens, you have ignorance about it, and your reaction to it gives rise to suffering. Samsara is what you get when you don't have wisdom, when you don't see the truth about your experiences. It is the state of mind where experiences give rise to kleshas, mental afflictions, disturbance in the mind, suffering. Where your natural reaction to what happens is to do the opposite of what would make you happy.
